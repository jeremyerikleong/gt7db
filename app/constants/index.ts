        title: 'new',
        explanation: 'In Gran Turismo 7 (GT7), the "new in used car list" refers to recently added or rotated vehicles appearing daily in the Used Car Dealership (UCD), often older classics or specific models not in Brand Central, providing fresh opportunities to buy rare cars for credits or potentially find duplicates of Café reward cars, as the stock refreshes daily and varies by region.'

    {
        id: 'soldout',
        title: 'sold out',
        explanation: 'In Gran Turismo 7 (GT7), "Sold Out" indicates that the car\'s limited availability window has expired, and it has been removed from the Used Car Dealership (UCD) or Legend Cars dealership. You cannot purchase a "sold out" car at that specific time.'

        id: 'engineSwap',
        title: 'engine swap',
        explanation: 'This is a tuning feature that allows players to install a different, usually more powerful or unique, engine into a compatible car to significantly change its performance and handling.'

    {
        id: 'rewardCar',
        title: 'reward car',
        explanation: 'A "reward car" (also known as a Prize Car) is a vehicle gifted to the player for completing specific in-game milestones. These are guaranteed prizes for finishing all races in a GT Café Menu Book, completing license tests (achieving all bronze or all gold results), achieving gold in Circuit Experience events, or finishing Mission Challenges.'

    {
        id: 'lotteryCar',
        title: 'lottery car',
        explanation: 'This is an unofficial term referring to a car won via a Roulette Ticket. Players earn these tickets through Daily Workouts or by completing certain Menu Books. When a ticket is used, a "roulette" animation displays various potential prizes (credits, parts, engines, or cars), but the specific prize is actually predetermined when the ticket is earned, and it can be difficult to land on the best options.'
    },
    {
        id: 'trophyCar',
        title: 'trophy car',
        explanation: 'Similar to a reward car, this term likely refers to a car obtained as a prize for achieving a specific trophy (e.g., a gold trophy in all license tests for a particular tier) within the game\'s challenge modes. These are guaranteed, one-time rewards for high achievement in difficult challenges.'
